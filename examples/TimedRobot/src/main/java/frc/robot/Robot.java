/**
 * Robot using Team 88's SwerveLibrary, using the TimedRobot framework without command-based
 * programming. The controller in use is an XBox controller, with the following mapping:
 *
 * <p>Left stick - Steer the direction of translation. Does not set speed. Right trigger - Sets the
 * translation speed of the robot. Right stick X - Spin the robot about it's center. Right bumper -
 * Hold for robot-centric steering. Otherwise, steering isn field-centric. Y button - Zeros the gyro
 * so that the robot is facing forwards. Only works while disabled.
