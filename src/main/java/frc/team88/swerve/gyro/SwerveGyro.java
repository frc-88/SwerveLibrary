/**
 * Represents a gyroscope. Values returned follow our rules for units and the field coordinate
 * frame. Specifically, units are in degrees and degrees per second, and are defined as follows:
 *
 * <p>"An angle of 0 degrees is defined as pointing in the direction of the positive y-axis,
 * increasing positively in the counter-clockwise direction and negatively in the clockwise
 * direction. The positive x-axis is at -90 degrees. The angle is not expected to wrap instead it
 * ranges from -180 to 180."
 *
 * <p>Technically classes which implement this interface have no way to enforce where the 0 angle
 * points, but it is expected that users will follow this rule.
